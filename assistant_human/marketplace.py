"""The marketplace registry — the TRUSTED map from a catalog app id to its deployable artifact.

The store forwards ONLY an app id; this table (baked into the socket-holding Team, never
caller-suppliable) decides what image actually runs, on which port, and with which needs. An app id
missing here is not installable — the storefront catalog may advertise more than the Space can deploy,
never the reverse. Every image is a reviewed pinned tag or digest: an artifact change is a code change
here, rebuilt like any other. Packaging follows the reviewed Assistant manifest contract.
