# Team HTTP protocol v1

Team owns the closed identifiers, payload projections, and WebSocket frame boundary used by Admin
and Store. `payload.py` validates Team-facing HTTP values without trusting upstream fields.
`websocket.py` validates the bounded `shimpz.chat.v3` frame primitives and redacts unsafe errors.
Thread pools, queues, worker limits, and saturation behavior are deployable-owned runtime policy,
not part of this wire protocol.

`vectors.json` contains positive and negative cases that Team, Admin, and Store execute
independently. Generated consumer mirrors pin the producing Teams commit, verify
`contract-files.sha256`, and remain byte-identical to this directory.

Validate the authority from this directory:

```console
python verify.py
```
